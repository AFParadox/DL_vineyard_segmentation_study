# Training Proceedure

## Obervations
- [OB_0002] GPU has not enough memory to train and validate Unet with BATCH_SIZE= 10
- [OB_0001] Cross training: Training set T2 as the lowerest performance in all networks. 
    - trainingset ['valdoeiro',qtabaixo], testset [esac]: esac has in general more green color then the other sets.; 


## TESTS:


# Savage Mode
The savage mode is a feature that loads all data at the start to mamory, which permits to run faster both in training and testing/validation. 


# Report 
Using the parameters of the original paper:
- MAX_EPOCH 50
- 

## Unet
From the figure below,the number of epochs should be higher to exploid
