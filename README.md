The dataset contains data from three vineyards from central Portugal (i.e, two vineyards from Coimbra and one from Valdoeiro). The data was acquired with a UAS that had a multispectral and a high-definition cameras onboard. The acquired images were used to build orthomosaics and digital surface models from the respective sites. 
The dataset's structure: 

- paper data
    - > ESAC1
        - > Multispectral
            - > sub-images
                - 0000.npy
                - 0001.npy
            - > sub-masks
                - 0000.
        - > RGBX7 (HD)
            - > sub-images
            - > sub-masks
    - > ESAC2
        ...
    - > Valdoeiro 
- Mulstispectral(RGB, RE, NIR and Thermal) orthomosaics
- High-definition orthomosaics 
- Digital Surface Models 
- the dataset is divided in three sets (ESAC1, ESAC2 and Valdoeiro), which correspond to three vineyards
