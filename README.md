The dataset contains data from three vineyards from central Portugal (i.e, two vineyards from Coimbra and one from Valdoeiro). The data was acquired with a UAS that had a multispectral and a high-definition cameras onboard. The acquired images were used to build orthomosaics and digital surface models from the respective sites. 
The dataset's structure:

    -> orthomosaics
        -> 
    -> raw data
        -> Coimbra
        -> Valdoeiro 
- Mulstispectral(RGB, RE, NIR and Thermal) orthomosaics
- High-definition orthomosaics 
- Digital Surface Models 
- the dataset is divided in three sets (ESAC1, ESAC2 and Valdoeiro), which correspond to three vineyards
